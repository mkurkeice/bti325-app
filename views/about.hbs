      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my Blog! Here, you'll explore a variety of my thoughts and interests while witnessing my experience expand in the world of Software Development.</p>
      <p>I have a wide range of interests that include arts like sketching in realism style, taking and editing photos, and makeup. When I was in highschool until first year 
        college, I was a freelance makeup artist doing all kinds of looks like bridal, prom, graduation photos, new years, birthday, nighttime and daytime glam, and more.

        Around the same time I took part in a hobby I hadn't done since elementary school, skateboarding. In the past all I did was cruise around with my friends in our residential
        until later I decided to build my own board and learn tricks. Before COVID hit, I learnt to do a short ollie and pop shuvit. Afterwards, COVID hit and that hobby died (for now) 
        and , a year later, I completed my diploma at Humber Polytechnic (at the time 'College') in Computer Programming. Before enrolling into Software Development at Seneca Polytechnic, I worked 
        at The Home Depot for a year to save some money. I still am an employee and I've worked for Home Depot for over 2 years now but I am currently taking an LOA for this school year and will
        be back with my Home Depot family before the summer starts.

        Another interest I have are cars. I've grown up around cars because my dad is a somewhat car guy. He is a classic car guy and he currently has 5 in his collection. His collection
        since the 80s has alternated between many American cars but the one car he has had since immigrating to Canada until now is the 1987 Datsun 280zx. He has sold his 280zx multiple times and 
        bought a new one because he can not truly let go of the significance of that car. I am next in line to inherit the car (because my brothers don't care about cars) but the reason I purchased
        my own car was because I need a more fixable and reliable car while I travel to and from school. In relation to the 280zx, since growing up with that car, I had developed a dream
        own a Z in the future as well. The difference is it is a newer generation than the 280zx, my favourite generation Z is the 2008 Nissan 350z; specificially the 2008 350z nismo HR. If you were to ask,
        I believe all the generational Zs are great except the 370z (in terms of cosmetics) and if the 350z had the 370z interior, it'd be unbeatable.

        Currently, while being a student at Seneca Polytechnic, I am exploring my old hobbies again like makeup and thinking of ways I can intertwine tech and beauty. I have a few ideas
        that I am laying out currently and hopefully throughout the course of my studies I can elevate my plan.
